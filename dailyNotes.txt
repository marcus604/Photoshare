Still working on verification. 
Need to properly log and action too many incorrect attempts
Scrub all incoming info to prevent SQL Injection attacks

Properly logging when connection is attempted without ssl
Tested using port scanning app
running overnight to see if any port scanning happens
Nothing

Need to properly log when incorrect username or password

May 12th

Still working on verification
Properly logging bad ssl, incorrect username and password

short passwords crash it

setting up environments so I can easily run the app on any machine
install sql on vm ubuntu
have it capable of creating database

need to properly kill process so socket is unbound

May 15th

Fixed bug that happens when length is less than 10, its only one byte and its reading two, grabs part of the data and screws it up
testing different inputs for username and password to find bugs
no password works fine
too long a password does not


need fix ConnectionResetError when app sends rst packet

bytestrings are much larger than bytearray
need to convert photoshare app to bytearray so I can properly pack data

may 16th

setup proper branch and git cmd line use
was using bytes already
handling long username and passwords now

may 25th

need to generate token to be used for existing session
can place it at the beginning of data 

Needs to check for both valid database but also that tables exist

trying to decipher why my receive messages thread is getting an empty packet, it looks like the fin, fin ack, but it doesnt make sense why it would get that
check if client crashing sends the fin fin ack

May 29th

Client crashing was sending fin, ack
catching value error above prevents the server from crashing - SORT OF DONE

When sending token from server -> client, there is a disconnect between the size of the data from server to client - DONE
client only reads 32 characters, rather than 32 bytes	- DONE

Need to send something back when login information is incorrect.

ubuntu not properly inserting new users into database

May 30th

Had to manually insert user into ubuntu mysql but it does validate user so it is properly executing SELECT statements

Need to refactor loginToServer() so that it receives either the valid token to start communication or if credentials are rejected and let it try again
Created new instruction '99' is error
server sends error if credentials are wrong

need to have client process wrong credentials and ask to try again
need to properly parse data into string to grab the token

June 1st

Setup proper alias to get working quicker

add to ~/.bashrc

alias shortcut='ls -l'

trying to format the message to view it on both client and server, easier to debug

should setup error instruction to have info in data like what the error is

should look at changing photoshare class so I create the photoshare object and set endian and version initially, then use helper methods createNewMessage, createNewError i.e

June 3rd

Created psUtil Class in the photoshare object
changing how psMessage is created

fixed/fixing printing of message

still debuging the changes so that psUtil works properly

June 4

getting close to returning to same state I was in before psUtil

have receive messages now converting the byte string to appropiate containers
server is crashing on ubuntu

back to getting validation to work when incorrect credentials are sent

June 5th

need to decide between severing the connection when bad credentials or to allow it to try again
