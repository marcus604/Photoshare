Still working on verification
Properly logging bad ssl, incorrect username and password

short passwords crash it

setting up environments so I can easily run the app on any machine

have it capable of creating database

need to properly kill process so socket is unbound

May 15th

Fixed bug that happens when length is less than 10, its only one byte and its reading two, grabs part of the data and screws it up
testing different inputs for username and password to find bugs
no password works fine
too long a password does not


need fix ConnectionResetError when app sends rst packet

bytestrings are much larger than bytearray
need to convert photoshare app to bytearray so I can properly pack data

may 16th

setup proper branch and git cmd line use
was using bytes already
handling long username and passwords now

may 25th

need to generate token to be used for existing session
can place it at the beginning of data 

Needs to check for both valid database but also that tables exist

trying to decipher why my receive messages thread is getting an empty packet, it looks like the fin, fin ack, but it doesnt make sense why it would get that
check if client crashing sends the fin fin ack

May 29th

Client crashing was sending fin, ack
catching value error above prevents the server from crashing
